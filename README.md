This repository contains my solutions to the labs and exercises as Jupyter Notebooks written in Python using:

Scikit-learn
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Patsy
StatsModels

Extras:
Holoviews

This repo only consists of the coding portions. I have not included the conceptual excercises for the sake of my limited time. But you can always reach out to discuss if you need help. These took me some time to reproduce, but the implementation details are not essential to the concepts taught in the book so please feel free to reuse. Also, a collection of all required datasets is provided in .csv format.
